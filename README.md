<h1> Power BI Project: Data Professional Survey breakdown  </h1>
<p></p>This Power BI project aims to analyze data on data analysts,
focusing on their preferred programming languages (Python, R, C/C++, JavaScript, Java, and Other). 
The goal is to visualize and understand the distribution of language preferences,
identify trends, and potentially uncover insights into the evolving landscape of data analysis tools </p>

Data Cleaning:
The raw data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, errors, and missing values.
This may involve standardizing language names, handling null values, and formatting data typeâ€™s appropriate

Data Transformation:
The data is transformed to create a suitable structure for analysis and visualization.
This may include creating calculated measures to derive insights
Data Modeling:
A data model is designed in Power BI to establish relationships between different tables or data sources.
This ensures efficient data retrieval and calculation for visualizations

The Power BI dashboard will incorporate various visualizations to effectively communicate the findings:
1.	Language Preference Distribution: 
o	Pie chart: Visualize the overall distribution of language preferences.
o	Bar chart: Show the number of data analysts preferring each language.
2.	Language Preference by Region/Industry: 
o	Treemap visualization: Map the distribution of language preferences across different geographic regions
Dominant Languages: Identify the most popular programming languages among data analysts
